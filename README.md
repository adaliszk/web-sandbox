# Web Prototypes

Monorepo for my experiments involving web technologies. Mainly for learning purposes, but also as a demonstration
of my skills as I learn over-time. The purpose of this repository is to build up a collection of references, and
have a playground to test new ideas and technologies.

### Prerequisites

- [`node.js >= 20.x`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) as the environment for development
- [`pnpm >= 9.0`](https://pnpm.io/installation) as the package manager
- [`biome >= 1.7`](https://biomejs.dev/) as the code formatter and linter

## Projects

Within this repository, my plan is to create projects to explore or learn, then archive them for future reference.
For now, I leave the projects in their original place but disable them in the workspaces definition so that links
and references would not break.
